# Backend Project Documentation

## Overview
This is a backend application built with Node.js and Express. It serves as the server-side component for a web application, handling requests, managing data, and providing responses.

## Project Structure
```

│   ├── app.js               # Entry point of the application
│   ├── controllers          # Contains the logic for handling requests

├── package.json             # Configuration file for npm
└── README.md                # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application:

## Usage Guidelines
- The application listens for incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate controller methods.
- You can access the root route at `http://localhost:3000/` (or the port specified in your app).
- Modify the controllers and routes as needed to expand the application's functionality.
